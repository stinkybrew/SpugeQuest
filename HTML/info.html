        <p>
        	SpugeQuest is a text adventure game based in modern Helsinki. The player experiences wintertime in Helsinki through the eyes of a homeless person, with a task to stay alive. The player must look for sources of heat, alcohol and small amounts of cash to keep himself alive through the winter.
          The game is a survival simulator based on the real world, there are no fantasy creatures to encounter or battles to fight. Instead, the player must fight the deadly environment that will slowly kill him, if he doesn't actively look for warmth and helpful items.
